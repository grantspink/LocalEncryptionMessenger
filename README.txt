--------General Overview--------
Read the project presentation pdf within the project folder for a
broad overview of the program.

-----Setting up the Program-----
This project is designed for two users to send encrypted messages between each other.
As such, upon starting the program, the user is presented with a login screen,
at which point they must register TWO NEW USERS.
This will create a folder within the project folder for each user.
Within each user's folder will be an INBOX folder and an OUTBOX folder.

--------Using the Program-------
Once you are logged in as a user, there will be a button with instructions on the page.
The instructions are pretty clear, but generally, the program uses public/private key
RSA encryption to hide plaintext within pictures.
Thus, each user will eventually be prompted to save a PRIVATE KEY somewhere on their computer.
Each user's PUBLIC KEY will be saved within the project folder.
